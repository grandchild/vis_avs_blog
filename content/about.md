This is the accompanying blog for the ongoing AVS GCC port at
https://github.com/grandchild/vis_avs.

I aim to make my thought processes around changes and decisions public, so that the code
and the commit log don't have to stand all on their own, if more high-level information
and background is desired.

You can blame [exo-cortex][exocortex] for the existence of this blog. I only started it
because he kept nagging me about Hugo and writing about the development process.
